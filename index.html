    <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Natural Language Processing (NLP) course focuses on understanding and developing systems that can process and analyze human language. It covers the theoretical and practical aspects of how computers interpret, represent, and generate natural language text. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The course develops both linguistic understanding and programming skills for language models, text classification, and semantic analysis. I expected to learn how modern AI systems like chatbots, translators, and recommendation systems use NLP techniques.

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unit 1:</strong> Understand the fundamentals of language, syntax, semantics, and morphology.</li>
      <li><strong>Unit 2:</strong> Learn text pre-processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.</li>
      <li><strong>Unit 3:</strong> Study word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe for semantic representation.</li>
      <li><strong>Unit 4:</strong> Explore deep learning models like RNN, LSTM, and Transformers for NLP applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Unit 5:</strong> Apply NLP in real-world applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p><strong>What new skills did I gain?</strong><br>
      I learned how to preprocess large text datasets, build and evaluate text classification models, and implement neural network architectures for language tasks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What was most challenging?</strong><br>
      Understanding complex architectures like Transformers and managing large language datasets during model training was challenging.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How did I improve from start to end?</strong><br>
      My understanding of both theoretical and applied NLP concepts improved significantly. I became more comfortable working with TensorFlow and libraries like NLTK and spaCy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How can I apply this knowledge in the future?</strong><br>
      I can apply NLP techniques in projects related to AI assistants, information retrieval, and text analytics in real-world applications.
